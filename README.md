# Recipe Application

To describe this project, this is an application to search, filter and discover recipes, with a simple interface for all users.

## How I've made this recipe application ?

It was mostly made with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api), an API specialized in food.

Additionally, there is the use of external packages, such as :

-   [React Router DOM](https://v5.reactrouter.com/) : Used for routes within the app
-   [React Splide](https://splidejs.com/integration/react-splide/) : Used to generate a slider
-   [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) : Used to have icons
-   [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/) : Used to style components
-   [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) : Used for creating transitions
